using System;

// Base class
class Vehicle
{
    public void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
    }

// Derived class 2
class Motorcycle : Vehicle
{
    public void Ride()
    {
        StartEngine(); // Calling the base class method
        Console.WriteLine("Motorcycle is riding");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Creating an instance of the first derived class
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Calling methods from the first derived class
        Console.WriteLine("Calling methods from the Car class:");
        myCar.StartEngine();
        myCar.Drive();
        Console.WriteLine();

        // Creating an instance of the second derived class
        Motorcycle myMotorcycle = new Motorcycle();

        // Calling methods from the second derived class
        Console.WriteLine("Calling methods from the Motorcycle class:");
        myMotorcycle.StartEngine();
        myMotorcycle.Ride();
    }
}


Output :--- 👦👦👦👦👦

Calling methods from the Car class:
